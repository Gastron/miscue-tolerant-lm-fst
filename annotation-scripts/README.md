Remarkably, basically the same FSTs can also be used to obtain a miscue-tagging given a prompt and an transcription of its reading. Scripts for this are provided here, but CAUTION: they have not been updated with the rest of the scripts, as this is needed rarely.

### Annotation:
- To annotate miscues in a transcription, first create annotation FSTs with make\_annotation\_fsts.sh and then run annotate\_miscues.sh
